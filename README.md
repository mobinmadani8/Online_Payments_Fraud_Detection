# Online_Payments_Fraud_Detection

## Importance of this work
Online payments fraud is a major problem for businesses and consumers alike. Fraudsters can use stolen credit card information to make unauthorized purchases, or they can create fake accounts to commit fraud. This can lead to financial losses, damage to reputation, and erosion of customer trust.

Online payments fraud detection is important because it can help to protect businesses and consumers from these risks. By identifying and preventing fraudulent transactions, businesses can reduce their financial losses and maintain a healthy bottom line. Consumers can also be protected from having their financial information stolen or used without their permission.

## What I did in this project
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to detect fraudulent online payments. I used a variety of features from the Kaggle PaySim1 dataset, such as customer information, transaction data, and device data.

* First, I cleaned and prepared the data. This involved removing duplicate data, correcting errors, and formatting the data in a consistent way.
  - we use dataset from this [Link]([/guides/content/editing-an-existing-page](https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?titleType=dataset-downloads&showDatasetDownloadSkip=False&messageId=datasetsWelcome&returnUrl=%2Fdatasets%2Fealaxi%2Fpaysim1%3Fresource%3Ddownload)).
  - we use <code>pandas</code> and <code>numpy</code> library to manipulatint.
  - for better performance we make onehot and scale method.

* Next, I developed a variety of machine learning models to detect fraud. I used a variety of algorithms, and in this project we focus to find best hyperparameter.
  - in this step I choose <code>RandomForestClassifier</code> from <code>sklearn</code> library.
  - and for hyperparameter tuning i use <code>RandomizedSearchCV</code> from <code>sklearn</code>.
* I evaluated the performance of the models on a holdout dataset of known fraudulent and legitimate transactions. I selected the model that performed the best on the holdout dataset.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning for online payments fraud detection. The model I developed was able to accurately detect fraudulent transactions with a high degree of precision and recall.

I hope that this project will inspire others to develop similar solutions to help protect businesses and consumers from online payments fraud.
